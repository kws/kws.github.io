title: Why now?

So, I've been holding off creating a new website since the 90s. After all my old
[university page](https://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~kws/) is still there and as relevant
as ever (although they seem to have forgotten to renew the SSL certificate),
so why would I need change?

In the last few weeks though I've worked (sometimes day job, sometimes more for
fun) on a few projects that I thought were worth sharing.

So - I'll write up a bit more in the coming days about these projects, but to
kick it all off, let me introduce "What's Next".

I don't know if it's just me, but I often find myself getting annoyed by the
default reminder from Outlook that I have meeting (online, of course - it's
2021 after all) in fifteen minutes. Fifteen! That's plenty of time for me to
forget all about it. Setting a snooze doesn't really work either because I'll
either forget, or just ignore it.

So, what I really want is a sidescreen that constantly shows what meetings are
coming up. The plan (there's always a plan) is to put a display on one of the
may [Raspberry Pi's](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
that seem to always be floating about the place... But I realise that most of my
plans never come to be. And in any case, I believe in agile, so how do I know
I would actually find it useful?

So... As a quick prototype, I put together [What's Next](https://www.k-si.com/whatsnext/)
a very basic [React](https://reactjs.org/) app pulling data from the
[MS Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview). Have a play, and
then [fork it](https://github.com/kws/whatsnext) and send me some cool PRs!
