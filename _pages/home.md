  - excerpt: 
        I'm lucky enough to have a job that I love, as well as a number of other projects that I'm passionate about.
        Here are some of the things that I'm currently working on.

    title: Social Finance
    excerpt: 
      Up until I started my relocation to the Netherlands, this was my day job where I had a dual role as CIO and Director in the Data and Digital team. I led the development of our data and digital strategy and oversaw the delivery of our data and digital products. I also led the development of our data science and AI capabilities. My role as CIO focused on ensuring that our technology and data infrastructure was fit for purpose and supported our business needs, as well as ensuring that we were compliant with relevant regulations.

    title: Science Outreach
    excerpt: 
        For several years now I have been part of a team of volunteers that support a science outreach event at festivals such as the WOMAD festival in the UK, and the colours of Ostrava festival in the Czech Republic. There I'm lucky
        enough work with the amazing Connie Potter of CERN and Dan Hardiker of Devoxx4Kids as well as a number of other academics and volunteers. We run a number of talks and workshops for children and adults covering a range of topics
        from AI to particle physics. We also run a number of hands on workshops.

    excerpt: 
        I've always loved lights. Whether they are stars or stage lights. My dad was a lighting designer at the Central Theatre in Oslo, and I grew up around stage lights. I've always been fascinated by the way that light can be used to create a sense of space and atmosphere. One of my very first electronic projects was using the Z80PIO expansion chip with the ZX Spectrum to directly drive a set of LEDs for the Christmas Tree. Lately I've fallen in love with addressable LEDs and the Rasbperry Pico and all the fun things that you can do with them.

    title: AI and Art
    excerpt: 
        I have always been fascinated by digital art and the way that technology can be used to create art. With the
        evolution of the 8-bit microprocessor and the games and demoscenes in the 80s and 90s, I was hooked.
        I've recently started to explore the use of AI to create art. I'm particularly interested in the use of GANs to
        mix styles and subjects. But this is of course not just linked to visual art, and the new generations of generative
        models open up for personalised and interactive art in a mixed medium.
