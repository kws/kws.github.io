Embarking on a journey into the world of virtual reality, Julian and I decided to dive headfirst into a project that not only challenged us but also allowed us to explore the endless possibilities VR has to offer. Inspired by the immersive experiences that VR games provide, we set out to create our own version of an endless runner game, tailored specifically for the Oculus Quest 2.

## Inspiration and Guidance

Our adventure began with a treasure trove of information we found in a comprehensive tutorial on Smashing Magazine, titled ["How To Build An Endless Runner Game In Virtual Reality (Part 1)"](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/virtual-reality-endless-runner-game-vr-part-1/). This guide became our blueprint, offering not only the foundational knowledge we needed but also diving into the intricacies of developing for VR. The tutorial walked us through setting up our development environment, creating the game's basic structure, and implementing the mechanics that make endless runner games both challenging and addictive.

## The Project: A High-Level Overview

Our project aimed to create an immersive VR endless runner game that could run seamlessly on the Oculus Quest 2. For those unfamiliar, endless runner games typically feature a character moving forward through a landscape, dodging obstacles, and collecting items, all while the game progressively speeds up and becomes more challenging.

In our version, players are transported into a virtual world where they must navigate through an ever-changing landscape filled with obstacles. The game utilizes the Oculus Quest 2's motion tracking and hand controllers, allowing players to physically jump, dodge, and interact with the game environment in real time. The immersive nature of VR means that every jump and dodge isn't just a button press but a physical action, enhancing the game's engagement and excitement.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the most significant challenges we faced was optimizing the game's performance for the Oculus Quest 2. Ensuring smooth gameplay without sacrificing visual quality required careful balancing, testing, and tweaking. Additionally, designing intuitive controls that felt natural in a VR environment took experimentation and user feedback.

However, these challenges were also our greatest learning opportunities. Through trial and error, we gained a deeper understanding of VR development, from the importance of user interface and experience design in a 3D space to the technical aspects of building for a standalone VR headset like the Oculus Quest 2.

## Looking Ahead

As we continue to refine our game, our journey is far from over. The possibilities in VR are endless, and this project has only scratched the surface. We're excited to explore more advanced features, incorporate player feedback, and expand the game's world with new challenges and surprises.

We encourage anyone interested in VR development or the technical details of our project to check out the Smashing Magazine tutorial that guided us. It's an invaluable resource for anyone looking to step into the world of VR game development.

Our adventure into VR game development has been challenging, rewarding, and, above all, fun. We look forward to sharing our game with the VR community and hearing your thoughts and feedback. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue this exciting journey!
